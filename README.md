# To Do Items

- End jumping when landing on more than just the ground. Example: the tumbleweed
- Weapon pick ups with good sprites
- Reload with animation
- Improve weapon anchoring (are sockets a thing in Godot?)
- Figure out a system for collision layers
	- Categories
		- Items that block the player (crates, etc...)
		- Items that dont block the player but can be shot (beer bottle, etc...)
		- Items that dont block the player but detect collisions (ammo crate, etc...)
- Figure out a system for signalling an object they have been shot
